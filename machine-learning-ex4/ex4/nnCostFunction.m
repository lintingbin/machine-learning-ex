%NNCOSTFUNCTION Implements the neural network cost function for a two layer
%neural network which performs classification
%   [J grad] = NNCOSTFUNCTON(nn_params, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, ...
%   X, y, lambda) computes the cost and gradient of the neural network. The
%   parameters for the neural network are "unrolled" into the vector
%   nn_params and need to be converted back into the weight matrices. 
% 
%   The returned parameter grad should be a "unrolled" vector of the
%   partial derivatives of the neural network.
%

% Reshape nn_params back into the parameters Theta1 and Theta2, the weight matrices
% for our 2 layer neural network
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));

% Setup some useful variables
m = size(X, 1);
         
% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
Theta1_grad = zeros(size(Theta1));
Theta2_grad = zeros(size(Theta2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
%               following parts.
%
% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
%         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
%         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
%         computed in ex4.m
Y = zeros(m, num_labels);
for i=1:m
	Y(i, y(i)) = 1;
endfor

h = sigmoid([ones(m, 1) sigmoid([ones(m, 1) X] * (Theta1'))] * (Theta2'));
MiddleJ = - Y .* log(h) - (1 - Y) .* log(1 - h);
MiddleReg = (sum((Theta1(:, 2:end) .^ 2)(:)) + sum((Theta2(:, 2:end) .^ 2)(:)));

J = (1 / m) * sum(MiddleJ(:)) + (lambda / (2 * m)) * MiddleReg;

%
% Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
%         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
%         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
%         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
%         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
%
%         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
%               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
%               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
%               cost function.
%
%         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
%               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
%               first time.
Delta1 = 0;
Delta2 = 0;

for t = 1:m
	a1 = [1 X(t, :)]';
	z2 = Theta1 * a1;
	a2 = [1; sigmoid(z2)];
	z3 = Theta2 * a2;
	a3 = sigmoid(z3);
	delta3 = a3 - Y(t, :)';
	delta2 = (Theta2(:, 2:end)' * delta3) .* sigmoidGradient(z2);
	Delta1 += delta2 * a1';
	Delta2 += delta3 * a2';
endfor
Theta1_grad = (1 / m) * Delta1;
Theta2_grad = (1 / m) * Delta2;

%
% Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
%
%         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
%               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
%               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
%               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.
